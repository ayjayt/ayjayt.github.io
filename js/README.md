Some readers notes:

Files are generally documented in godoc style- files have explanations at the top and functions/variables are commented above.

There are // STATE comments littered throughout, and they are numbered if they are part of the correct path. This is to help you write hooks or events.

version.sh will add a version string to the "app". I use git commit --amend
