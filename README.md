This is a data explorer that redownloads and retabulates data on every refresh.

Obviously, that doesn't make sense in the long run. The totals and statistics should be calculated once serverside (even in the excel file) every time the data is updated.

But it's fine for now. Hopefully it gets some clicks!

(It's pretty organized IMO)

Calculate every permutation serverside in python

# TODO:

* TODO's within code (grep)
* image indicating is a little hokey, more positives etc
* shouldn't all severe + moderate + mild cough = any cough?
* maybe not 100% for "% of patients with cough amoung those with cough"
* add edit filter maybe
* change select to ul for mobile's sake
